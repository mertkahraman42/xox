/* Let's define a struct to represent the XOX table as a matrix of 9.
We can think of an XOX table as the following:

(0,0) | (1,0) | (2,0)

(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1)

(0,2) | (1,2) | (2,2)

// Below are some examples of what sort of inputs the game would expect
//let exampleX = Point(x: 0, y: 0, state:1) This is an X played onto the lower left side of our XOX table.
//let exampleY = Point(x: 0, y: 0, state:10) This is an X played onto the lower left side of our XOX table.
